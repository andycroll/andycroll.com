In the gym listening to my regular dose of comedic Britishness from [BBC Radio 4's](http://bbc.co.uk/radio4) [podcast of The Now Show](http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/fricomedy/) when the song maestro [Mitch Benn](http://www.mitchbenn.com/) broke into a little song-ette about kids in British primary schools being taught about social networking.

The podcast has expired, due to [crazy assed BBC rules](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/help/faq/podcast_availability.shtml) so I dug up the song on YouTube and present it here for your enjoyment.

## Lyrics

A blog is just a diary,<br />
you post on the Internet,<br />
so everybody in the world can read along.

It means you're under the impression,<br />
that your every waking thought,<br />
is a source of fascination but you're wrong.

Then there's MySpace which is full of dreadful Indie bands,<br />
who want a record deal although it's a lost cause.<br />
Then there's Facebook which is mainly a way to reassure yourself,<br />
that your buddies' lives are just as dull as yours.

A podcast is a radio show,<br />
you make and post yourself,<br />
so doesn't matter if it's really crap.

MP3s are just a clever way,<br />
of stealing people's songs,<br />
which is why the record industry's collapsed.

Wikipedia is a site where you could have looked all this up for yourself,<br />
if you weren't such a lazy git,<br />
and Twitter is for messages that last a 140 characters or less,<br />
and I'm the [king of it](http://twitter.com/mitchbenn).
