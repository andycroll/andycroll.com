Given it's a dynamic language, it's important that Ruby comes with several excellent debugging and introspection features out of the box.

Finding the exact place a method or block of code is defined and being able to read the related source code is essential for effective debugging and code comprehension. In Ruby, the `source_location` method, provides a powerful tool for retrieving the file and line number for where a particular method or block is defined.


## Explore Rails usingâ€¦

...the `#source_location` method.

```ruby
"Cars".method(:singularize).source_location
#=> ["/.../activesupport-7.0.8/lib/active_support/core_ext/string/inflections.rb", 60]
```

Then open from the command line:

```shell
bundle open activesupport
```

...which opens the named gem in your editor of choice for you to explore.


## Why?

Use of `source_location` is invaluable when you're new to an application, re-exploring unfamiliar code, or trying to understand which gem is providing the functionality you're using.

Reading source code is a great way to learn. Reading battle-tested code like that of Rails itself, or other gems, even more so.

Thanks to authors of the framework `source_location` works for "magic" meta-programmed methods in Rails. Methods on Active Record [associations that are generated using `class_eval`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/activerecord/lib/active_record/associations/builder/association.rb#L103) pass special syntax to enable the lookup to still work. If it weren't for this when you called `source_location` you'd just see `(eval)` as the first result.

```ruby
class Car < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :seats

  # ...
end

Car.first.method(:seats).source_location
#=> [".../activerecord-7.0.8/lib/active_record/associations/builder/association.rb", 103]
```

Then open from the command line:

```shell
bundle open activerecord
```

## Why not?

While you're experimenting, you might find that this doesn't always work.

```ruby
"Cars".method(:upcase).source_location
#=> nil
```

Methods included as part of "core" Ruby are often implemented in C, and their definitions are not directly accessible from Ruby code. Therefore, calling `source_location` on a core method will typically return `nil`.

The `source_location` method only works for methods defined in gems where the source code is in Ruby. It won't work for methods that use a C extension (where Ruby code calls out to C).

Also, while `source_location` can be invaluable during development and debugging, it's not generally suitable for regular use in production code.
