title: "An Explanation of Web Standards"
layout: post

I was putting together a proposal for a site this morning. I normally try and avoid jargon, and explain concepts in as simple terms as possible, but can't really avoid using (good) terms such as 'Web Standards', 'CSS', 'unobtrusive JavaScript' and 'graded browser support'.

I explain these terms in a few sentences, highlighting the benefits to search engines and maintainability. When I realised, clients probably ignore this entire page assuming that all web designers use the best techniques, which in Singapore is sadly not true in the slightest.

So this part of the proposal needed to indicate that this is a _difference_ between [one of the best web design companies in Singapore](http://deepcalm.com) (egomaniac alert) and a lot of the shabby work done by other less savvy agencies. I'm also tired of being perceived as expensive compared to 'web shops' that churn out the [same](http://2010.andycroll.com/writing/when-websites-go-wrong-flash) [horrible](http://2010.andycroll.com/writing/when-websites-go-wrong-whitespace-tiny-fonts) [mistakes](http://2010.andycroll.com/writing/when-websites-go-wrong-the-little-things) all the time.

So I put together a little sidebar that encourages a little discovery on the client's behalf to examine a competitor's own site or proposal and make sure the client is not comparing apples to oranges.

I'm pretty happy with that.

If a client isn't willing to invest a little time in researching who they want to use to build their site, they may be a difficult or disinterested client anyway. I like to work with people passionate about their businesses, it rubs off on me and I do better work that way.
