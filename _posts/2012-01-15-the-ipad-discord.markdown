title: The iPad Discord: Thoughts on iPad disruption of the PC Market

A few discussions that have come together in my life in the last couple of weeks lead me to believe that [this graph on CNN](http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/01/13/snapshot-of-computer-market-with-and-without-the-ipad/) (via [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/01/13/market-share-ipad)) that shows major growth of iPad sales and PC sales decline.

My inputs are all circumstantial but I can quite believe the graph shows causation, not merely corrolation.

## The iPad discord

My iPad is my favourite device, but the one I could most easily do without.

This realisation came to me when my wife ended up with a free iPad as a result of a work benefit. "What do I use it for?" my response was "everything except complicated stuff".

I reach most often for the iPad for instapaper reading, web surfing, the guardian app, note-taking, writing, twitter and gaming. It's, most often, the best device for me. I can do all these things on my phone or laptop but not as enjoyably.

But...

In these early days of the 'post PC era' we're still not in a place where advanced spreadsheeting, serious coding or even pulling from dispirate applications is possible. Not yet.

So I couldn't give up my laptop for these more specialised tasks, and obviously as the CTO and lead programmer on a startup that's not realistic. And I wouldn't enjoy giving up the power of the portable smartphone in my pocket.

## Not replacement, supplement

The other thing I notice is the appearence of iPads in the hands of people for whom computers are not such a key tool in their lifestyle. Parents of friends & people who keep their work at work in corporate jobs. They likely have a computer at home, but rarely use it for complicated stuff, but every now and then they do.

My theory is this:

Instead of an aging PC being replaced with a new one it is simply relegated to those 'once in a blue moon' tasks and a new, relatively cheap, iPad becomes the everyday machine, _because it's better for that 80% of cases and it's cheaper_. The old PC is kept around to do those few tasks that are more suited to a traditional keyboard and mouse arrangement.

I think the PC market is suffering from a) a recession and b) the relatively cheap iPad eating into their PC replacement sales. In addition, the iPad is a high margin product whereas the PCs it's cannabising are low margin and cheaply made. This could get really bad for the PC hardware guys.
