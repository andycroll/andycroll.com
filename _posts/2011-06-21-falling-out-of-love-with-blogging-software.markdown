I've been through Textpattern, Wordpress, Tumblr and Posterous: all the time looking for that perfect platform that would help me write more. But we all know that doesn't really happen.

You should own your own and beware the fragility of "free" online services. This is my writing, I'd like (whatever is relevent) to survive in the coming yearsâ€”I don't want to be [geocities-ed](http://geocities.yahoo.com/index.php).

I have a long standing (unrequited) love for Textpattern, but it creaks so badly these days and surprisingly for a solo author Wordpress feels like overkill - it really is becoming the mini-CMS it has always threatened to be.

This is my site. A place for writing. A place for reading. A place where I can tweak the design and typography to my heart's content.

The design is fully responsive (read [Ethan Marcotte's masterpiece][bkaprt4]) and I've embraced a fluid grid. I'm a great believer in designing for multiple screens at the same time, particularly in a 'mostly' text situation such a blog.

The font-size and line-height scale with the window width and the fluid grid to retain a sensible line length for comfortable reading.

I'm using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) running on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)) and I have my writing as flat markdown files.

It feels both DIY but also terribly elegant, minimal tools, no database setup and no overheads. I need access to a 'real computer' to add posts, but then I find I do most of my writing at a computer rather than a 'post PC' device.

No comments. [I'm with John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/2010/06/whats_fair). *Second part of the article*.
