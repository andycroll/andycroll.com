title: Essential iPad Apps

I've managed to keep spending relatively under control during the first week. Only buying my absolute essentials.

### Reeder *4.99*

My go to app for RSS feeds for iPhone is even prettier on iPad, a shame about having to buy again, but it is a whole new app.

### Instapaper *4.99 (but I'd already purchased)*

If you read off a screen you need this. A beautiful minimal reading experience for long form web content. And buy the 'pro' Universal app, it's worth every penny.

### Twitteriffic *free, 4.99 in-app upgrade*

I don't think the app website does the product justice in use this is incredibly slick, useful and the tweets aren't as 'big' as they seem in the screenshots. I haven't upgraded in-app yet, but I suspect I may have to if the official Twitter client doesn't head over soon.

### Flipboard <small>free</small>

It's been all over the internet for the last week. A really interesting approach to consuming news content that utilises twitter, not a new idea, but a terrific interface. Just great attention to detail.

## Gaming

### Money Island 2: Special Edition <small>9.99</small>

The irony of playing a 17 year old game on my 'future-pad' has not passed my by. However this might be proof that great writing outlasts technology. A beautiful graphical and audio update of one of the finest games ever made.

### Flight Control HD <small>4.99</small>

My favourite of the iPhone gaming 'modern classics'. A must buy. Now all I have to&nbsp;do is not be so rubbish at it.

### Canabault <small>2.99 (but I already had it)</small>

[canabalt.com](http://canabalt.com/)

A rare universal game, it's in the pixel art style so I guess no need to redo the art, but it's nice to see some iDevs giving love to their existing customers.

## Upcoming purchases...

I'm looking at [wireframing apps](http://corvusconsulting.ca/2010/07/wireframing-on-the-ipad-revisited/), so far [SketchyApp](http://sketchyapp.com/) seems to be the simplest and best option for me, I'm not confident that [OmniGraffle](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle-ipad) can offer 10 times as much value. I'll be referring to app-a-holic [Winnie](http://winnielim.com/) to see which she recommends. I have considered wire-framing in Keynote, but I'm not sure if the iPad version can cope with that level of [Keynote Kung Fu](http://keynotekungfu.com/).

I've managed to avoid rebuying the iOS gaming greats for now, but am sure [Angry Birds HD](http://www.chillingo.com/sku.htm?sid=309) is in my future. [Gravity Hook HD](http://www.gravityhookhd.com/) from the Canabalt creators [Semi Secret](http://semisecretsoftware.com/) is universal (yay!) and I will no doubt buy [Plants vs Zombies](http://www.popcap.com/games/ipad/pvz) again at some point.

It's a shame you can't upgrade the iPhone versions of these apps (that I already own!) to the HD versions for three reasons...

* it'd reduce the sticker shock for loyal customers
* only one app to manage in iTunes
* removing horrible 'HD' marks from the icons and accompanying text ('FlightCtrl HD'? Seriously? Ugh.)

[Hit me up on twitter](http://twitter.com/andycroll) with any other recommendations on which to squander my cash.
