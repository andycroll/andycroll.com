**Note:** This refers to a previous design of [deepcalm.com](http://deepcalm.com), which was my business site.

And so, only two months after the start of the New Year, a new version of deepcalm.com. Built on the excellent, but ever so slightly frustrating, [ExpressionEngine](http://www.expressionengine.com/index.php?affiliate=deepcalm). It seems there's a bit of a redesign madness going around, my feed reader reports on [Jeff Croft](http://jeffcroft.com/blog/2008/feb/15/its-brown-yo/), [Jon Hicks](http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/fiddling), [Jared Christiansen](http://www.jaredigital.com/article/227/this-is-where-i-write-the-hey-internets-i-redesigned-teh-site-post-and-you-all-pretend-to-be-excited) and a new site from [Greg Wood](http://www.greg-wood.co.uk/blog/post/sod-it-its-live/) (which is just lovely, plus he's opinionated enough to do reviews too).

I'd been promising myself an update to the site for the last six months, but had been putting it off in order to make the leap from Textpattern to the often recommended EE. Finally after leaving [Bezurk](http://bezurk.com) just before Christmas I decided to rebuild, in between learning the initially impenetrable EllisLab creation and client work (and endless 'Now I don't like that' moments) I've been beavering away.

In terms of design, I've kept the rainbow but lost the 'graffiti' style text for the name. I'm a little lighter on images for each article and have streamlined the layout so that the main area of text is a little larger - bringing the focus to what is unique (and useful) on each page. I've also separated out the reviews into their own section (although they still form part of the feed) and added links to the blog in a blatant homage to [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net).

I'll no doubt keep tweaking, but it pretty much works ok in all decent browsers. As for IE6, you won't get nice fixed position headers and transparency effects, but it pretty much looks the same. Not bad huh!
