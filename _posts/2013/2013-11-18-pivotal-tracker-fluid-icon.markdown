_Updated for Yosemite's Icon Grid on 29th October._

I'm a big fan of using a [fluid app](http://fluidapp.com) for the more 'app-like' websites I keep open all day and the main tool that gets used like this in my life is [Pivotal Tracker](http://pivotaltracker.com).

They changed their logo over the weekend and my Mac OS X icon OCD kicked in.

They don't provide a large enough version on their site, so I quickly rebuilt it using [Sketch](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) (which is totally awesome).

It's 1024x1024 so it'll even look nice on your retina screens, if you're lucky enough to have one.

> If you're into Tracker you might be into Rails so you might be interested in a couple of books I'm writing... [Building Ruby Gems](/building-ruby-gems) and [The Ultimate Guide to Running Rails on Heroku](/ultimate-guide-to-rails-on-heroku). Head over and sign up to hear when they are released.
