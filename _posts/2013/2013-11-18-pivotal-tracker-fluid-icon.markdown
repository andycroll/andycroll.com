_Updated for Yosemite's Icon Grid on 29th October._

I prefer to use a [fluid app](http://fluidapp.com) for the more 'app-like' websites I keep open all day and the main tool that gets used like this in my life is [Pivotal Tracker](http://pivotaltracker.com).

They changed their logo over the weekend and I needed a Mac OS X icon. They don't provide a large enough version on their site, so I quickly rebuilt it using [Sketch](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/).

It's 1024x1024 so it'll even look nice on your retina screens.
