With the [aquisition of Mark Boulton Design by Monotype](https://markboulton.co.uk/journal/mbd-and-monotype/), its publishing operation, Five Simple Steps, shut down and returned all the book rights to their respective authors. And then it was run for a little longer, by [Craig](https://twitter.com/craig_makes) & [Amy](https://twitter.com/AmieNLockwood), but then… sadly no more.

So should you want to buy these fonts of knowledge where should you go?

Authors are doing a variety of things with their books, some are freeing the content, some linking with distributors, some (like me) are selling them direct.

Here's the list.

There’s also [Future Simple Steps](http://www.futuresimplesteps.com).

As I write, authors are frantically sorting themselves out, so if more books appear… let me know [@andycroll](https://twitter.com/andycroll).

An aside, we're trying to get google-juice-friendly redirects sorted from the old URLs to the new ones, for now… this'll have to do.
