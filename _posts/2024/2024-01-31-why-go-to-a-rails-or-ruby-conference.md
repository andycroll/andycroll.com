Conferences have always been a big part of my career as a developer. Attending, speaking, and running events—off the side of my desk—have played a massive part in my career, job prospects, and personal relationships.

Enough about me. What about you? Why should you take a day (or two, or three!) off work, spend a bunch of money, get lectured from a stage, and then have to talk to strangers in a strange town halfway across the country?

## Professional Development

A conference is _not_ training. At most a talk can impart useful syntax, or explain a concept, or help to bridge where you are to _where you could be_.

A conference is a great place to find out the latest and greatest thinking in your particular area of work or to be introduced to facets of your career that you haven’t had the chance to consider in the everyday, unrelenting, demand for features and bug fixes.

Even a couple of hours of workshop delivered as part of an event’s programming, _isn’t_ training. You do sometimes get full days of classroom training attached to conferences, but those tend to be specific, full-days & smaller groups; those _are_ training!

If information isn’t being downloaded into your head, then why bother? The videos will be online soon and you can always read the documentation.

Thinking like this misses the point. You won’t watch the videos, the YouTube counts under my own conference talks would indicate those numbers round to zero.

You’re not enabling the serendipity of being in a talk you would have avoided where an insight unpacks a problem that your team have been struggling with for months.

The relent from the day-to-day is a chance to pause and reflect on your everyday struggles and use the event as a springboard to better times.

## Inspiration

I think of two kinds of inspiration.

One is the regular kind: a talk contains the nugget of understanding you need to take a new technique, or piece of thinking, day to your day job and solve a problem that you or your team have been facing.

The other is more intangible, and easy to scoff about.

Meeting someone, or seeing a talk, the changes the trajectory of your career. You might choose a product company, if you’ve been in agency life. You might lean hard into open source work and make that a foundation of the next phase of your career. You might meet someone who, in three years, starts a company and remembers that great meal you had and asks you to join them.

All these things are possible if, and only if, you’re in the room where it happens.

## Hiring

Conferences are a great place to meet folks from other companies and many sponsors are actively trying to hire developers in the hallway track.

Does that mean that if you send folks in your team they’re all going to leave for better places to work? No. If you are concerned that this may happen, then you have _a lot_ of work on your own organisation.

Folks move jobs frequently in the world of software. If you’re not out there extolling the virtues and benefits of working with you, if your team are not out there doing the same, how difficult will it be for you to hire your next engineer?

### Isn’t it a vacation? 
You shouldn’t think of a conference as “time off work”. It’s not. It’s a chance for you and your team to pause, get your head up and see how you can make a difference in your day-to-day work and the wider community.

There’s opportunities to learn about new technologies, from other—bigger and smaller—teams doing things both the expected way and with within an esoteric approach that might chime with your approach to software.

## It is pleasant

Our jobs are increasingly remote, with our chosen career leading the charge in enabling sensible ways of working where we can work from anywhere, but that doesn’t replace the need for human connection.

A programming conference can provide a place for folks on your team to enjoy time together in, in person, in a work-like environment to rebuild connections

The finest people, that I’m lucky to call friends, have been made or we’ve had our bonds strengthened due to attending a conference. Either existing teammates seen outside the normal day-to-day or strangers becoming friends or future colleagues.

Even as I stand on stage and deliver a talk or MC a conference, I’m burning energy that means after my “jazz hands” I’ll have to go and hide in a cave for days afterward to recharge.

Many programmers self-describe as introverted, but then that’s who is at these conferences, introverts _like you_—with your same fears and worries—yet they understand you because they _are just like you_. What a lovely bunch of folks to hang out with.

## Because you’re a human being first

A recent episode of the Big Ideas podcast featured the American academic Robert Waldinger: the current director of the Harvard study of Adult Development. This study, begun in 1938, is the longest running investigation into the wide-ranging causes of our individual happiness, or the opposite.

A major finding was the value of social connectedness.

“...the people who stayed the healthiest and lived the longest and were happier, were the people who were the most connected to others. People who saw more people in a given week; people who had warmer connections to others. Their brains stayed healthier longer, they had less cognitive decline and their brains declined more slowly as they aged.”

If “you will live, healthier, longer” doesn’t convince you to get out of you chair and meet other programmers, I don’t know what will.

Self-interestedly I’ll recommend getting tickets to [Brighton Ruby](https://brightonruby.com) (which I run every year) and [RailsConf](https://railsconf.com), which I’m co-chairing in 2024. But there’s so many great options for events at [rubyconferences.org](https://rubyconferences.org).
