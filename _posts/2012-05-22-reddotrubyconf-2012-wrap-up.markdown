Thanks to all who came, and all who spoke. The feedback I've had has been mostly lovely and for that I'm really grateful.

## Feedback

Mostly food-related.

I need to:

* Ensure there is enough if there is yummy finger food
* Label veggie options
* Perhaps provide some fruit in the breaks

Wifi remained a hot topic. Some loved that they couldn't distract themselves, some felt like they'd lost a limb. Pot-a-to, Po-ta-toe.

Potentially do an hour of lightening talks at some stage, I'll be looking for volunteers to run this!

Some feedback for you... I'd really appreciate it if you could all buy your tickets a bit earlier next year so I'm not freaking out with a month to go next time. :-)

See you next year. Ideas, comment, adoration, critique to [andycroll@deepcalm.com](mailto:anycroll@deepcalm.com)
