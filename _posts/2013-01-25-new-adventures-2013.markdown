I’ve jealously looked at Colly and Greg’s [New Adventures](http://2013.newadventuresconf.com) from afar. This year, due to my relocation to the UK, I was able to finally show up to the final part of their trilogy. I can confirm that it's as marvellous as everyone says it is.

Colly hosted the day with an air of confidence and nonchalance that speaks to the well oiled team that back him up on this annual escapade. As someone who has run conferences, and can normally find fault in most events including my own, this was an absolute belter.

I attended [Steph Hay’s](http://www.stephaniehay.com) workshop on the Wednesday, which provided a lot of timely advice on content and speaking in the user’s language that’ll be fed into ImpulseFlyer in the coming weeks. Her focus on removing meaningless language from your copy and using Google Adwords to drive your copy from the language being used to search was terrific.

## The Day Itself

The speakers on the day itself were without exception, excellent.

### [Jason Santa Maria](http://jasonsantamaria.com), [@jasonsantamaria](http://twitter.com/jasonsantamaria)

He shared the experiences of his increasingly non-linear design process developed during his time at Typekit and A Book Apart. Something that I’ve found too working in more product-focused, ship-all-the-time companies.

Concepts that you have to embrace include “there’s no real concept of done” and a much more participatory process. Jason also covered his love of ugly, rough paper sketches that are hewn over time and via a mixture of tools (PSD, HTML, Illustrator whatever) into a final web product.

For me, this has to be a call to arms for the pure photoshop designer, in order to work effectively in the web, you must work in the web and embrace its inherent flexibility.

### Tyler Mincey, [@FictiveTyler](https://twitter.com/FictiveTyler)

With a voice like chocolate Tyler shared his career history including five incredible and stressful years at Apple in the iPhone and iPod teams. His focus was that the romantic vision of the ’creative alone’ is bullshit, healthy teams are key to getting your stuff into the world.

Healthy teams are small and everyone has the 'burden of responsibility', it's important to have a strong sense of ownership. Respect was a key theme, both in terms of a mixture of experience and youth and in terms of being able to challenging opinions within a team. He quoted an oft heard phrase on the Apple campus, “help me understand...” to try and get to the ’why’ of a decision.

Tyler also addressed understanding of your constraints, in order that you might not be bound by them, but be able to move them.

Finally he discussed his move from the world’s biggest company and the top of its game, to “a bunch of dudes from the Internet”. [Fictive Kin](http://fictivekin.com) (which sounds like a great gig) is about designing a lifestyle for its partners rather than designing Christmas presents. An admirable reason to move on.

### [Michael Heilemann](http://binarybonsai.com), [@heilemann](https://twitter.com/heilemann)

A brief chat about finding your place in the world. “Find your fucking bliss”

He amusingly recounted his accidental elevation to famous-on-the-Internet through the creation of [Kubrick](http://theme.wordpress.com/themes/kubrick/), the default Wordpress theme for a number of years.

His unquenchable passion for CMS design is inexplicable to himself, but he followed his passion to a job he loves at [SquareSpace](http://www.squarespace.com). A humble personal testament to finding your career.

### [Tiago Pedras](http://blog.tiagopedras.com), [@tiagopedras](https://twitter.com/tiagopedras)

Another more experiential talk that raised the ugly spectre of most of the web design and development teaching in further education. And he revealed himself as an _actual_ CSS Ninja, a black belt no less.

He covered the traits he was trying to instill in his students by learning from those who taught him; self-respect, perfection, self-discipline, self-awareness and passion.

Tiago recounted the transformation in the way his course was taught; abandoning lectures, forming teams within the students and running the course as a contained (and somewhat protected) “business”, in order to compete for the coveted “golden coconut” the students acquire the knowledge in the service of their project.

I strongly concur with his initial statement that it is our mission to give something back. It is.

Somewhat related was the [code club](http://www.codeclub.org.uk) movement that was covered in the lunch break. Worth a look.

### [Jon Tan](http://jontangerine.com), [@jontangerine](https://twitter.com/jontangerine)

The web is about reading, so we must understand its structure and convention.

Billboards & novels. Impact & immersion. Interruption & absorption. John effused about the power of typography to control user’s emotion and attention.

Jon presented some interesting research into type and user’s attitudes to aesthetics. Typesetting itself has no effect on comprehension speed, due to the general marvelousness of the human brain. HOWEVER if something is more attractive users get in a good mood and underestimate the time they spent! Time truly flies when you're having fun.

Having established the import of type, and our emotional reaction to it, Jon then dived engagingly into understanding the utility of fonts and using them where they're meant to be used.

Think about letter differentiation, Jon uses the string ’agh! iIl1 O0’ as a method of quickly establishing a font's many details. When setting body type its important to remove interruptions but don’t show off! Consider hyphenation for small screens and _please_ prevent typographical orphans.

Design places, not postcards. We're building tools for use. Jon gives great talk.

### [Seb Lee-Delisle](http://seb.ly), [@seb_ly](http://twitter.com/seb_ly)

Probably the most engaging performance on stage, Seb gave a hilarious live coding art display on a C64 and JS and extolled people to “hybridify” themselves.

He deconstructed the oft repeated refrain “I love learning new stuff” pointing out it is actually a horrible experience, finally settling on “I love having learned new stuff”!

Full of wry asides and superb comic timing he still managed to cover a couple of inspirational points. Side projects are important but you must finish them, then they can lead to opportunities you haven't thought of. You don’t want to be making other people's stupid ideas.

### [Stephanie Troeth](http://stephanietroeth.com), [@sniffles](https://twitter.com/sniffles)

Steph’s talk was a strong counterpoint to Seb’s. Melancholic, considered and conceptual the talk explored the Japanese concept of wabi-sabi and the impermanence of our work.

I was worried that the talk had meandered off course but as it wrapped up it left questions hanging in the air and indeed evoking the very sensation that she discussed.

### [Wayne Hemingway](http://www.hemingwaydesign.co.uk)

This all too brief career summary from the creator of Red or Dead could have continued for several hours and I'd have been happy. A natural raconteur, telling stories he's told a hundred times, he had the crowd enraptured.

He talked about the impact the ’creative industry’ has on the UK economy (£15b!), its return on investment and how lucky we are to just have a really fun job.

He told the scrappy tale of Red or Dead, and revealed his two traits that he thinks elevated them above people who are just as talented as them.

1. Be likable!
2. Have something you stand for. People come for your philosophy.

He then discussed his house, really community, [building efforts](http://www.hemingwaydesign.co.uk/projects/urban-design) and his new project [Dreamland](http://www.hemingwaydesign.co.uk/projects/design/dreamland-margate). Just a spectacular talk.

### [Jessica Hische](http://jessicahische.is), [@jessicahische](https://twitter.com/jessicahische)

She explored her self-coined term Procrastiwork and through that covered a much broader topic, that of being mindful in your career and happiness.

“The work you do while you procrastinate is he work you should do for the rest of your life.”

Jessica described how important it is to keep your life in balance, using amusing charts to describe the different work that she does and also showing how this balance is equally critical in relationships.

She encouraged people not to focus too hard on your dreams, but to focus on the moment and your happiness in that moment. The fancy title you might want on your business card is not what you actually do all day.

She used humor incredibly effectively, as she clearly does in her own life, to show the ridiculousness of some of the things we do and to therefore not take herself too seriously.

I can only agree how important diversity and balance is in my own work life, the last year has been so much ImpulseFlyer at times it's been tough.

The after party was well attended, no free bar could handle the onslaught of thirsty NAConfers. My only disappointment was the snowed-off fr00tball, but as all powerful as Colly is he can't control the weather.

I can only say that this event will be missed, but Colly and Greg have metaphorically dropped the mic and walked off the stage at the height of their powers.
