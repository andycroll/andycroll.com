I've been working on ImpulseFlyer since 2011 and I've learnt a huge amount about being a (mini) founder in a VC-backed company. However, the time has come for me to move on.

Part of it is a need to change, part is that I've realised, having done it once, that VC-startup-land is not for me as a founder. There'll be a longer post around that coming down the pipe, when I have some greater perspective to how I fit into the ImpulseFlyer 'story'.

I'm incredibly proud of how far we've been able to take the product and of the feedback we get from our customers. I remain involved with ImpulseFlyer but only in an advisory capacity.

This is not to say I don't enjoy startup work. I do, I really do. A stodgy corporate is not my bag.

I'll happily share coffee and war stories with any early founders that want some advice on their idea, technology or strategy. I've got skills to offer and experience to share.

For now my focus is on sharpening my skills alongside a more stable life (including reasonable paycheck).

Looking at my plans for this year I'm...

* starting my second Ruby conference, [Brighton Ruby](http://brightonruby.com)
* keep shipping [my bootstrapping newsletter](http://bootstrapping.io) once a week
* writing books on [Building APIs with Rails](http://buildingapisbook.com), running [applications on Heroku](http://railsonherokubook.com) and Building RubyGems (website to come!)
* Ship a [movie side project](http://dribbble.com/shots/1209611-Movies-UK-App) for iOS
* working as a senior Ruby developer and/or designer, somewhere

...so I'm not able to be not busy it seems.
