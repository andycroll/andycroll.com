title: Responsive Redesign
layout: post

I've been growing frustrated with [Textpattern](http://textpattern.com). A trusty tool for my client work days, but despite a growth spurt last year increasingly stagnant. Plus if I'm rebuilding I should learn something new, right?

After finally climbing aboard Wordpress for [The Naked Startup](http://nakedstartup.com) (our behind the curtain blog about [Gameplan](http://gameplanapp.com)) I realised that were I to use it for this site I'd merely be swapping like for pretty bloody similar. So I decided to [archive](http://2010.andycroll.com) the old site and explore the world of tumblr.

I [agree with Dan Cederholm](http://stream.simplebits.com/post/755661723/welcome-to-the-bitstream), my hope is that this new blog will help me post more and remove some of the maintenance of hosting my own site. A single page template and simple publishing. Amen.

## The New Shiny

So when it comes down to it, I've used this blog to experiment a little. [HTML5](http://books.alistapart.com/product/html5-for-web-designers), web fonts by [Typekit](http://typekit.com/), [responsive design](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/). Jesus, it's like web-buzzword-bingo in here.

An iPhone-ish version is provided responsively by the @media stylesheets, and there's an in-between narrower version with a wider header. Just resize your modern standards-compliant browser window.

The design is somewhat inspired by the advent of Safari Reader and my continuing use of Instapaper over reading the actual text as set on the page. I wanted to try and create something that would allow readers to care about the content, rather than a load of extra surrounding gubbins.

I was aiming for a modern-retro feel and tried to limit myself to black and white as much as possible.

Other influences are the [Seed Conference](http://www.seedconference.com/seed.php) site, [Colly's recent refresh](http://colly.com/comments/redesigning_the_undesigned/) for it's retro stylings and [Jon Hicks' reflexive redesign](http://hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/) (plus it was his [tweet about tumblr](http://twitter.com/Hicksdesign/status/15920972262) that set me off down this route... even if he gave up in the end).

IE6 is readable and I'm testing IE7, do [drop me a line on twitter](http://twitter.com/andycroll) if you spot a rough edge.

## Justify Yourself

One trick I'm reasonably proud of is the one-line-justification in the page header.

It's a simple trick to get around a single line acting like the final line of the paragraph (not normally justified) so I added a class and then jQueried a load of non-breaking spaces to the end of the line, and manually set the height in CSS.

Have a look in the source if you're interested.
