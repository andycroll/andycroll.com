_I left Singapore in late 2012, this information is from then and may decay._

I’ve set up a couple of comapnies in Singapore, including [ImpulseFlyer](http://impulseflyer.com/welcome/andy) and have gradually formed a group of companies and people who I rely on to do the stuff that isn’t ‘making websites awesome’.

Thought I’d put a bunch of them in the same place.

## Bookkeeping (and general advice awesome)

### Juanita Sabapathy, [Kolbri](http://kolibri.sg)

The font of all knowledge for bookkeeping, admin and ‘the way things work’ in Singapore. Just an all round star. Knows the startup-scene incredibly well.

## Lawyer

### Chin Sing Ping, [Chin & Associates](http://chinandassociates.com)

Fast, startup-friendly, good value and looks about half his age, the handsome devil.

## Insurance

### Anthony Lo, [Elpis Financial](http://elpis.com.sg)

Sorted out healthcare for ImpulseFlyer (important and not as expensive as you’d think) and public liability (for Red Dot).

## Printing

### Larry Chan, [Prensa](http://prensa.sg)

Rendered awesome (boutique) business cards and let me geek out over paper for ImpulseFlyer. For any other more standard printing needs is super fast.

## Banking

### DBS Business Banking, [DBS](http://dbs.com)

Absolutely horrible online, but at the time was the only bank to allow a new account to have a business debit card. The most open to giving a merchant account to a startup and transacting in USD. You still have an arbitrary limit of one year of operations though.

I have heard good reports of Standard Chartered for general banking, but their payments people are awful.

## Payments

### [AsiaPay](http://asiapay.com.sg)

Helpful and have a one-stop-ish solution that even includes China-specific debit cards. Helps when dealing with the banks (and AMEX) if AsiaPay are involved. Currently under implementation.
