I have a code of conduct for Brighton Ruby and have had for all five years of it’s existence.

Last year was the first time I had to use it.

I realise that there’s a lot of ‘why you should have one’ and not a lot of ‘what is it like to enforce one’. Enforcement is the _entire_ point of the code of conduct.

I run the conference from my wholly-owned limited company. Thus legally Brighton Ruby is a private event. I have the ability just not to do ‘business’ with anyone I don’t wish to.

I’m lucky in this respect as it allows me to run the event as a ‘benevolent dictator’ within whatever scope the nice people who generally attend will allow me.

Anecdotally, I’ve heard of more reports of code of conduct breaches at a variety of events recently. I consider this to be a _good thing_. These things are happening anyway. It’s _much better_ to hear about and deal with them, than not to hear and leave those affected feeling unable to attend our events. It means we’re making our community better.

This article lays out the process and principles that I currently use to maintain the safety of my attendees and encourage the best behaviour of everyone involved.


# On fairness, intent and privilege

Before we start, I am a British, white, middle-class and (increasingly) middle-aged man. This means I cannot necessarily accurately understand the experiences of people who do not share my in-built societal privilege.

I do my best as a ‘very visible for one day’ member of our community to empathise and ‘do right’ by individuals from under-represented groups. I also try to compensate for, and am willing to be corrected on, my own inevitable blind spots.

I will trust individuals to accurately report their understanding of other’s behaviour as it effects them, while bearing in mind any power dynamics that also affect the incident.

It feels hard to exclude people from any community, for ‘just saying things’ or for ‘being a bit creepy’, but I say that _from my perspective of cultural safety_. I am perfectly willing for that to be a possible outcome of any reported incident.


## On genuine apologies

In the case of small conversational infractions, or where you’ve expressed yourself awkwardly I’d suggest the following. A genuine apology (avoid qualifying phrases like ‘for causing offence’) and a resolution to talk less, smile more and think about how better to express yourself next time.




## A rough grading

I read with interest a Washington Post article on [how a restaurant dealt with harassment] of it's waiting staff, grading the behaviours of. I've adopted a rough grading of severity of incidents.

### Yellow

I consider these to be in the category of things you can walk back with a genuine apology and a resolution to not repeat.

If you express yourself poorly or misjudge a joke, and you upset someone unintentionally.

If you use language in a way that is likely to exclude.

When confronted (hopefully in a friendly manner by a fellow attendee)


### Orange

I'd consider these to be more serious or continual use of language or behaviour that excludes, undermines or 'others' an individual or group.

This also includes repeated yellow incidents. Particularly after a request to stop from another attendee or member of conference staff.




### Red

This is serious or sustained physical or verbal assault.


# Being on the receiving end of an incident report

As for individuals who may feel harshly treated for behaviour they perceived as fine... the intent of your behaviour doesn’t matter. The effect of your behaviour matters. The perceived ‘correctness’ of your argument doesn't matter.

Censure of your behaviour may not feel ‘fair’ but from the broader perspective of an event organiser I would rather err on the side of understanding and empathising with anyone made to feel unsafe by another attendee.


## On the scale of Code of Conduct infringements



## In the case of an incident at Brighton Ruby, reported during the conference

I will err on the side of the victim/reporter.

If I receive notice of a contravention of the behavioural standards expected of attendees I will ascertain the detail of the issue as quickly as possible, including any third parties to the incident.

In the first instance I will recommend the  seek the opinion of the victim/reporter as to the preferred course of action. This includes immediate expulsion of the perpetrator if it will make the victim feel safer in the Brighton Ruby environment. It’s important to say this is an option that is very much on the table, as I take the Code of Conduct very seriously.

If the victim doesn’t want the individual to leave the conference, I will arrange any resolution required by the individual. This might include a chaperone, or some form of safer space for the individual.

I will follow up with victims/reporters after the conference to establish if they believe any further action is required, including banning from future Brighton Ruby events, and/or if they feel that the right decision was made in the heat of the moment.


## In the case of an issue at Brighton Ruby, reported _after_ the conference

I will err on the side of the victim/reporter.

In a similar way to incidents reported during the conference I will establish the details of the incident, understand the preferred course of action from the victim/reporter and take the necessary action.

This action can, again, include banning the perpetrator indefinitely from future Brighton Ruby events. They end up on my personal unwelcomelist.


## The unwelcomelist is not public

I have no interest in becoming the community police, or outing people. The Brighton Ruby unwelcomelist is primarily for my own use.

In cases of serious endangerment of attendees or if I became aware that an banned individual was attending or speaking at another conference I may reach out to the organisers.

I have been discussing, with the loose community of organisers I know in Brighton and other organisers in the wider UK Ruby community about some form of information sharing, but for that to occur we’d have to maintain the anonymity of our attendees.

Plans are at the ‘we should do something about this’ stage. At the moment we would have to rely on word-of-mouth and our personal relationships to communicate if there were any dangerous individuals. We are taking legal advice on when/what it is appropriate to share.


## You can get on the Brighton Ruby unwelcomelist for incidents at other events

I have taken the decision that if I hear about behaviour at another event that would have resulted in expulsion from Brighton Ruby that you will go on the unwelcomelist.

This also means victims can report incidents at other events as if they were at Brighton Ruby and I will treat them as such. The same confidentiality, the same care, the same protection.


## If you end up on the unwelcomelist...

You may not know, unless the incident that put you there was reported during the event and you were asked to leave.

I check ticket sales (and assignments) for matches against the handful of people on the Brighton Ruby unwelcomelist. If you obtain a ticket and you are on the unwelcomelist I will refund your ticket purchase and email you directly to let you know you aren’t welcome at the event.

I will explain the broad category of behaviour that has made you unwelcome at the event, but will not explain the ‘when’, ‘where’ or ‘what’ of the incident or who has reported the issue.

This is to protect the victim/reporter: which is the point of the CoC in the first place. This protection of reporters is important as it helps with the reporting of incidents in the first place and thus enables the CoC to do its job.


## Getting off the unwelcomelist

This hasn’t happened so far.

I’m inclined to suggest you’ll remain on the unwelcomelist indefinitely. The only way to make sure you get off the list, is never to get on it in the first place.

I’m not able to assess apologies or ‘reformed’ behaviour. So I’ll err on the side of being strict for now.


## I’m interested to hear from you

I’m likely to be missing something.

Do you run a conference, do you do something differently? Let me know.

Have you reported something at a conference and had a good experience or bad one. What more could I do?
