I have a code of conduct for Brighton Ruby and have had for all five years of it’s existence.

Last year was the first time I had to use it.

I realise that there’s a lot of ‘why you should have one’ and not a lot of ‘what is it like to enforce one’. Enforcement is the _entire_ point of the code of conduct.

I run the conference from my wholly-owned limited company. Thus legally Brighton Ruby is a private event. I have the ability just not to do ‘business’ with anyone I don’t wish to.

I’m lucky in this respect as it allows me to run the event as a ‘benevolent dictator’ within whatever scope the nice people who generally attend will allow me.

Anecdotally, I’ve heard of more reports of code of conduct breaches at a variety of events recently. I consider this to be a _good thing_. These things are happening anyway. It’s _much better_ to hear about and deal with them, than not to hear and leave those affected feeling unable to attend our events. It means we’re making our community better.

This article lays out the process and principles that I currently use to maintain the safety of my attendees and encourage the best behaviour of everyone involved.

# On fairness, intent and privilege

I am a British, white, middle-class and (increasingly) middle-aged man. This means I cannot necessarily accurately understand the experiences of people who do not share my in-built societal privilege.

I do my best as a ‘very visible for one day’ member of our community to empathise and ‘do right’ by individuals from groups who aren’t represented in our community in the same numbers as people who look like me.

This means that I will trust individuals to accurately report their understanding of other’s behaviour as it effects them. And I will err on the side of trusting the opinion of those offended, rather than trying to judge solely from my perspective.

It feels hard to exclude people from an event, for ‘just saying things’ or for ‘being a bit creepy’, but I say that _from my perspective of cultural safety_.

As for individuals who may feel harshly treated for behaviour they perceived as fine... the intent of your behaviour doesn’t matter. The effect of your behaviour matters. The perceived ‘correctness’ of your argument doesn't matter.

Censure of your behaviour may not feel ‘fair’ but from the broader perspective of an event organiser I would rather err on the side of understanding and empathising with anyone made to feel unsafe by another attendee.

In the case of small conversational infractions, or where you’ve expressed yourself awkwardly I’d suggest the following. A genuine apology (avoid qualifying phrases like ‘for causing offence’) and a resolution to talk less, smile more and think about how better to express yourself next time.


## In the case of an incident at Brighton Ruby, reported during the conference

I will err on the side of the victim/reporter.

If I receive notice of a contravention of the behavioural standards expected of attendees I will ascertain the detail of the issue as quickly as possible, including any third parties to the incident.

In the first instance I will seek the opinion of the victim/reporter as to the preferred course of action. This includes immediate expulsion of the perpetrator if it will make the victim feel safer in the Brighton Ruby environment. It’s important to say this is an option that is very much on the table, as I take the Code of Conduct very seriously.

If the victim doesn’t want the individual to leave the conference I will arrange any resolution required by the individual. This might include a chaperone, or some form of safer space for the individual.

I will follow up with victims/reporters after the conference to establish if they believe any further action is required, including banning from future Brighton Ruby events, and/or if they feel that they made the right decision in the heat of the moment.


## In the case of an issue at Brighton Ruby, reported _after_ the conference

I will err on the side of the victim/reporter.

In a similar way to incidents reported during the event I will establish the details of the event, understand the preferred course of action from the victim/reporter and take the necessary action.

This action can, again, include banning the perpetrator indefinitely from future Brighton Ruby events. They end up on my personal black list.


## The blacklist is not public

I have no interest in becoming the community police, or outing people. The Brighton Ruby blacklist is primarily for my own use.

In cases of serious endangerment of attendees or if I became aware that an banned individual was attending or speaking at another conference I may reach out to the organisers.

I have been discussing, with the loose community of organisers I know in Brighton and other organisers in the wider UK Ruby community about some form of information sharing, but for that to occur we’d have to maintain the anonymity of our attendees.

Plans are at the ‘we should do something about this’ stage. At the moment we would have to rely on word-of-mouth and our personal relationships to communicate if there were any dangerous individuals. We are taking legal advice on when/what it is appropriate to share.


## You can get on the Brighton Ruby blacklist for incidents at other events

I have taken the decision that if I hear about behaviour at another event that would have resulted in expulsion from Brighton Ruby that you will go on the blacklist.

This also means victims can report incidents at other events as if they were at Brighton Ruby and I will treat them as such. The same confidentiality, the same care, the same protection.


## If you end up on the blacklist...

You may not know, unless the incident that put you there was reported during the event and you were asked to leave.

I check ticket sales (and assignments) for matches against the handful of people on the Brighton Ruby blacklist. If you obtain a ticket and you are on the blacklist I will refund your ticket purchase and email you directly to let you know you aren’t welcome at the event.

I will explain the broad category of behaviour that has made you unwelcome at the event, but will not explain the ‘when’, ‘where’ or ‘what’ of the inciting incident or who has reported the issue.

This is to protect the victim/reporter: which is the point of the CoC in the first place. This protection of reporters is important as it helps with the reporting of incidents in the first place and thus enables the CoC to do its job.


## Getting off the blacklist

This hasn’t happened so far.

I’m inclined to suggest you’ll remain on the blacklist indefinitely. The only way to make sure you get off the list, is never to get on it in the first place.

I’m not able to assess apologies or ‘reformed’ behaviour. So I’ll err on the side of being strict for now.


## I’m interested to hear from you

I’m likely to be missing something.

Do you run a conference, do you do something differently? Let me know.

Have you reported something at a conference and had a good experience or bad one. What more could I do?
