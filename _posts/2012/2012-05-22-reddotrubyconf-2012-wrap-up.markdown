## Feedback

Mostly food-related.

I need to:

- Ensure there is enough if there is yummy finger food
- Label veggie options
- Perhaps provide some fruit in the breaks

Wifi remained a hot topic. Some loved that they couldn’t distract themselves, some felt like they'd lost a limb. Pot-a-to, Po-ta-toe.

Potentially do an hour of lightening talks at some stage, I'll be looking for volunteers to run this!

Some feedback for you… I'd really appreciate it if you could all buy your tickets a bit earlier next year so I'm not freaking out with a month to go next time. :-)

See you next year. Ideas, comment, adoration, critique to [andy@goodscary.com](mailto:andy@goodscary.com)

## I Want To Be Better

_as performed live at the end of [RedDotRubyConf 2012](https://reddotrubyconf.com)_

![Speakers](/images/2012/rdrc-2012-speakers.png)

I want to be better.

I want to be [fast](https://twitter.com/igrigorik).
I want to [contribute](https://twitter.com/nzkoz).
I want to think about the [stuff that no-one else is](https://twitter.com/winstonyw). And have someone help me.
And I want to build a [musical robot](https://twitter.com/sausheong) that will, one day, rule us all.

I want to [understand how my software works](https://twitter.com/gnufied). Or why [it's slow](https://twitter.com/hone02).
I want to do things in [ways you wouldn’t think of](https://twitter.com/hasclass). Or prepare for [other people to use my work](https://twitter.com/sutto) in new and interesting ways.
I want the world to know [what I'm _fucking_ doing](https://twitter.com/walski).
And I [want to pair](https://twitter.com/luweidewei) with my Jedi Masters and my best friend.

I want all the [tiny bits of awesome](https://twitter.com/holman) I learn to stay in my head, and not fall out like they normally do.
I want to use [cool new stuff](https://twitter.com/obie), not just because its new but because it makes the work I do more awesome. Or makes something [complicated, beautiful](https://twitter.com/gabehollombe). Or perhaps because I want to to stop putting crappy, [slow code in production](https://twitter.com/akomba).

I want future me to look back and thank current me for the sensible decisions I made. The ReadMe I wrote. [The effort I took to do things right](https://twitter.com/schneems).
I want to remember [how Tupac died](https://twitter.com/secoif). Inept JavaScript apparently.

I want to think about [how I behave effects others](https://twitter.com/danishkhan). And I want the the people I work with to concentrate on _being_ better.
I want to [craft the future](https://twitter.com/carlcoryell) with my own hands, a screen and a keyboard. And I want that future to be _great_.

But mostly, right now, I want a drink.
