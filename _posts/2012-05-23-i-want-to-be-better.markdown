I want to be better.

I want to be [fast](http://twitter.com/igrigorik).
I want to [contribute](http://twitter.com/nzkoz).
I want to think about the [stuff that no-one else is](http://twitter.com/winstonyw). And have someone help me.
And I want to build a [musical robot](http://twitter.com/sausheong) that will, one day, rule us all.

I want to [understand how my software works](http://twitter.com/gnufied). Or why [it's slow](http://twitter.com/hone02).
I want to do things in [ways you wouldn't think of](http://twitter.com/hasclass). Or prepare for [other people to use my work](http://twitter.com/sutto) in new and interesting ways.
I want the world to know [what I'm *fucking* doing](http://twitter.com/walski).
And I [want to pair](http://twitter.com/luweidewei) with my Jedi Masters and my best friend.

I want all the [tiny bits of awesome](http://twitter.com/holman) I learn to stay in my head, and not fall out like they normally do.
I want to use [cool new stuff](http://twitter.com/obie), not just because its new but because it makes the work I do more awesome. Or makes something [complicated, beautiful](http://twitter.com/gabehollombe). Or perhaps because I want to to stop putting crappy, [slow code in production](http://twitter.com/akomba).

I want future me to look back and thank current me for the sensible decisions I made. The ReadMe I wrote. [The effort I took to do things right](http://twitter.com/schneems).
I want to remember [how Tupac died](http://twitter.com/secoif). Inept JavaScript apparently. 

I want to think about [how I behave effects others](http://twitter.com/danishkhan). And I want the the people I work with to concentrate on _being_ better.
I want to [craft the future](http://twitter.com/carlcoryell) with my own hands, a screen and a keyboard. And I want that future to be _great_.

But mostly, right now, I want a drink.
