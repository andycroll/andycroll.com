[Memoization using the `||=` operator](ruby/memoize-expensive-operations) is a useful and straightforward performance optimisation. However, this isn't a suitable solution for cases when the expensive operation might result in `false` or `nil`.


## Instead of ...

...repeating potentially expensive calculations:

```ruby
class OldTimeySweetShop
  def any_jars_nearly_empty?
    @any_jars_nearly_empty ||= glass_jars.any? do |jar|
      jar.count_each_sweet_by_hand < 10
    end
  end
end
```


## Use...

...the `defined?` method with an early return.

```ruby
class OldTimeySweetShop
  def any_jars_nearly_empty?
    return @any_jars_nearly_empty if defined?(@any_jars_nearly_empty)

    @any_jars_nearly_empty = glass_jars.any? do |jar|
      jar.count_each_sweet_by_hand < 10
    end
  end
end
```


## Why?

Use of the `#defined?` method is technically the more "correct" way to perform memoization.

The `||=` (or equals) operator literally means:

```ruby
a || a = possibly_expensive_computation
```

A consequence of this is that if `a` is "false-y", meaning set to `nil` or `false`, then the right-hand side of the `||` is executed. This is potentially a big issue because if the expensive computation is legitimately returning `false`, it will be run every time the method is used, completely circumventing the improvement we are attempting.

I've used `Enumerable#any?` above to illustrate that this `defined?`-based technique can be useful to improve performance for methods that loop over large datasets and might return a boolean or `nil` result.


## Why not?

Often, a memoized result won't be `nil` or `false`, and in that case this style is undoubtably more visually noisy to read, and possibly trickier to understand, when you come back to it later on.

### Beware Threads!

You should be careful when using memoization in a high-throughput, threaded Ruby environment. You probably are. `sidekiq` is threaded and many Ruby web servers are as well.

When your code is reaching _outside_ of the Ruby interpreter (e.g. reusable database connections, file handling, writing to a data store, manually creating background threads) it is possible to introduce race conditions if your code is called by multiple threads at the same time. However, youâ€™re unlikely to be doing this in the course of a day-to-day application. Still, it is a possible source of bugs, so be aware!

Hat tip to Ivo on this one, he's resolved [bugs in open source projects](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-rb/pull/1329) that demonstrate this issue. You can see his recorded talk on [spotting unsafe ruby patterns](https://ivoanjo.me/blog/2018/10/13/spotting-unsafe-ruby-patterns/) which dives into the details.
