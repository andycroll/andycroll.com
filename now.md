### Before...

Podcasted with my Portland-based friend Vaidehi [Chats in the Cupboard](https://chatsinthecupboard.com) which is on hiatus.

We sold [AnswerThePublic](https://answerthepublic.com) to Neil Patel to better focus on CoverageBook in 2022.

Also ran, then sold, “Life.Time.Value.”, a conference for people looking to make the leap into internet-focussed product or Software as a Software businesses.
