title: Mac App Store, Lazy Person Tax?

So I, like a million others, hammered the Apple Servers and have been examining the Mac App Store. In short I like, it makes it easier for me to give money to developers and keep applications up to date.

Did find one thing that caught my eye...

[Clip It!](http://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/clip-it/id402285846?mt=12) a webpage capture tool.

It's available for 4.99 on the store, but it's **also** available on the developers own website as [freeware](http://www.headnix.com/download). You can even click through from the item page itself!

I'm certainly not criticizing the developer in question, people should be paid for their software (particularly if it's well focussed and does a great job. Which ClipIt! certainly does.

I'm just wondering if this is going to be a trend. Simple apps that didn't justify setting up license keys, cart & credit card processor and thus end up as hobby products now appearing on the store... but (and here's the key difference) remaining free if you have the nous to google for them.
