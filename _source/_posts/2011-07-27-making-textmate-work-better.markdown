[DNF]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_Duke_Nukem_Forever

The wait continues for Textmate 2, which is is the [Duke Nukem Forever][DNF] of the text editor world. However **Textmate still  mostly works**, so whilst I might crave an update to stop it beach-balling on large projects or stalling as the syntax highlighter chokes on minified Javascript or even just to make it look a bit more 'OS X Lion-ish', it's still the best thing out there.

But you can fix some of it's most obvious faults.

## Peepopen

Download [Peepopen](http://peepcode.com/products/peepopen)

A replacement for the somewhat limited command-T filename-in-project search, see git status, and include directory names in the fuzzy matching. From the splendid [Peepcode](http://peepcode.com), created by the even splendider [Geoffrey Grosenbach](http://twitter.com/topfunky).

## Project Plus

Download [ProjectPlus](http://ciaranwal.sh/projectplus)

Swaps the project draw for the updated look of a panel, add SCM status icons, and lots more little tweaks. *Essential*.

## Ackmate

Download [Ackmate](https://github.com/protocool/AckMate/downloads)

No more achingly slow Find in project. Ack is a control-option-command-F away. Then you might want to add [some extra filetypes](https://github.com/protocool/ackmate/wiki) if you use stuff like [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/).

## Remove Trailing Spaces (bundle)

Download [Remove Trailing Space and Save macro](http://mjijackson.com/2009/01/textmate-macro-remove-trailing-space-and-save)

Trailing spaces are the devil's work in source control. A bit annoying if you use the built-in code block folding (it unfolds on file save) but very useful.

## Railscasts Theme

Download [RailsCasts Textmate Theme](http://railscasts.com/about)

I like it.

## Better Bundles

	bash < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/gist/443129)

All the work of [@phuibonhoa](http://twitter.com/phuibonhoa)

Use this command to get updated bundles for Ruby, Rails, HAML, Sass & Shoulda.

Happy to add any I've missed, drop me [an email](mailto:andycroll@deepcalm.com).
